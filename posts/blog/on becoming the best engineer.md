Okay. For context, I am writing this to procrastinate watching my electrical engineering lecture, so I may not be the most qualified to talk about what you need to do to become the best engineer.

But I think I need to desperately have a radical shift in my perspective on working hard and becoming the best engineer. I need to have this serve as a reminder of my goalposts and as a write up on how to fix my laziness.

Why do I need to become cracked?
- I am going to a shitass university in a shitass state: The school I go to do not add any benefits to my employability and may in fact even detract from it. There is already a gap between me and individuals from more prestigious universities.
- I am a retard: I am not smart and I certainly don't work the hardest. There is no role to be filled by someone who doesn't work nor think hard. The two metrics also have some sort of correlation.
- More than ever, my education matters. What I learn (and everything beyond the scope of it) will help my employability and my skillset. Whilst high school taught a lot of non transferable skills, I feel as if university brings on a new set of challenges, which holds a greater application tailored to my job.

What I have going for me:
- Time. I am going into my first year of university and this is the greatest leverageable asset I own. I am starting at the earliest point of my career and exponential growth rewards the early starters. I believe if I truly "lock in" and find a way to work in a state of constant flow towards my goals, I will have a significant advantage over all of my peers.
- I have studied before. Year 12 I have increased and tracked my hours to an unprecedented degree. I felt the benefits of working on something everyday and whilst there are some glaring issues with my methods (brainrot), it has dramatically improved my understanding on learning.
- I am surrounded by talented and intelligent individuals, and I shall seek myself out for help with my tutors and the top students.

What I have against me:
- Brainrot - Tiktok and Instagram's algorithms are a trap of one's souls to reach a higher order of understanding. 
- I can't read - Reading is difficult for me and my brain cannot process more than a few pages at a time without intermission. This is truly a deficit to my studies as I found the most complex detailed and rewarding knowledge is attained from reading.
- Laziness - I can't get up to do something, and when I do, I can't get myself to plan for it, and when I do, I can't get myself to start the first line, and when I do, I can't get myself to continue for a long time, and when I do, I always give up before finishing it.

What do I want to be?
- Okay. For this I need to write more context about the degree I am studying. I am currently studying a double degree of Mechatronics Engineering and Bachelor of Computer Science that sums to 5 years.
- However, I find myself gravitating to the software engineering role rather than mechatronics role.
- But the first year is a PRE-Engineering year, so a lot of the major computing units (DSA, OS) are not done until my second year. So I have to learn things like electrical engineering. My biggest problem is that I do not know if I want to allocate my focus towards that since its not intrinsically related to my field, even if I can become an incredible polymath what really are the benefits of knowing how to circuit analysis when doing transformers?
- I want a role as a software engineer for big tech or quant company, or maybe a rapidly accelerating startup - highly competitive salaries with even more competitive job positions.
