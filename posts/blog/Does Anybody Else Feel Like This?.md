Today is Sunday, 8th June of 2025. Like many other sundays, I spent the whole day doing a whole lot of nothing. I wake up at 10-11am, and I eat breakfast and my other morning doings, and by the time I finish, its 12:00 and I am in a severe motivation rut.

Point is: I get into very severe cycles which contains periods of doing something and even longer periods of doing nothing - where I complain and I complain until something happens, causing me to **do something**. I feel like this is HEAVILY related to my intrinsic motivation to do something. And its a huge problem as a student - because nobody (outside nagging parents/professors), expect you to do things.

When I was 12-16, this was my motivation cycles:

Whenever I had a burst of motivation, I was able to make meaningful progress in my work. I can finish 1 project and a bit every cycle, which was amazing.

But now, at 18, I feel like my motivation has died down a lot, and have transformed into rare, occasional bursts of small amounts of energy to make things happen.

You can also notice that my general bar for motivation is a lot higher (or my motivation peaks at a much lower point) - Point is, I don't get as motivated as I used to. Btw, this is only true for side projects I do. 

Maybe it is because of the past being compounded together I look back at milestones as periods of time, rather than now, where I am living through the ups and downs of everyday motivation, but it clearly feels like I am starting, and giving up projects, faster and quicker than before.

Doing nothing is awful, and awfully addictive; because doing nothing feels so good in the moment, but feels so terrible so quickly. The opposite is true for doing something - it is painful, until you get it, then another pain point (bugs, errors, BUGS) appears.

When doing something, the peaks would probably be higher when you fix a bug, but you are generally still operating in a zone of "I'd rather not be doing this" - especially at the start.

Okay. I get it. You're impatient. "Get to the point already!!!" you are probably thinking,,,

Anyways, I've watched this video today, and I think these tips are really applicable and great: something I really want to apply to my everyday life.

Here are the breakdown of tips I want to apply into my everyday life.
1. Exercise: I apply this already, but its usually in the afternoon. Nothing I can change but still good to know.
2. Timer: This idea works a lot for me and I think is great for doing a task I dont want to start (majority of things) - I can just do a 1-5 minute timer and by the time its finished im already too into the weeds of it I dont want to stop. I think the problem with this approach is that I don't know what to do; In the video's example, he talked about video editing but I feel like I don't have goals or projects to do something.
3. Clean up: I wish I applied this more; a clean workspace is a clean mind. A clean mind is clean work (sometimes) (yes I did come up with that. I know it sucks.)
4. Accountability: This I felt like was the most important tip and something I wish I did more. I am a pretty secretive person I feel (?) But I think it would be good to just make general promises of things I am doing WITH a deadline. I rarely do that but when I do it becomes a race not to break promises.
5. this leads to my other point: I think making small promises to myself and becoming a person who doesnt break promises to himself would be amazing. I want to be able to promise myself something and will myself to do it! But i feel like I cheated one too many times and now can break all the rules I want :cold_sweat:

Anyways this brings me back to a problem. I dont really understand my goals.

My general long term goals are obvious: Be fit, Have money, Have good friends, Have good time. But what after that? Idk. I still havent sorted out my thoughts on this yet. I have general ambitions of where I want to, but it usually encompasses multiple general statistics. I think it would make sense if I turn it into an analogy:

Ramble Warning: In Hypixel Skyblock (or any MMORPG for that matter), you can do multiple things; You are given a vast number of skills to work on and level up, and its designed in a way you usually have multiple goals, and the goals are within such a short distance you know what to obtain (grindable within days or weeks; some end level have goals reachable in months). But in real life, I feel like its the same; there are many goals, but the only difference is I just don't know what to grind for - is it my studies? Is it money? What stat do I want to build up? I want to build all of them! Im not completely sure if this makes sense, but my point is that I feel overwhelmed and also contrastingly limited by what I can do!!! I feel like every goal I have is such a long term goal it also would take years to reach my dream "build" or dream "item"? Like in Hypixel Skyblock I see hardened diamond armour -> ender armour -> strong dragon armour -> superior dragon armour and its a logical progression? But I don't have a mindmap for my goals (other than the gym) Like getting a CS internship from nothing to a CS job has no meaningful milestones in between? Do projects? Idk!!!!!!!!!! 

Anyways. Short, Rambly Article Over. Time to build!!
