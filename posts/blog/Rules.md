**Rules**
1. Be ambitious
2. Be creative, think outside the box
3. Don’t reinvent the wheel, iterate on the wheel
4. If you find yourself to be the most ambitious or the smartest person in the room, find a new room
5. There is always a solution to the problem, but you won’t always find the solution immediately - you might need to fix hundreds or thousands of other problems before the solution is solvable/becomes apparent
6. Industry is changing so always be up to date with the tools the industry is using.
