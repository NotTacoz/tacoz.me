## Part 1 Electricity
- What is electricity?
- What does electricity do?
- Why is electricity important?
- What are **other** forms of energy.
- What is electric **charge** measured in?
- What is **current**?
- What is electric **current** measured in? 
- What does a typical electric circuit contain?
- What is the direction of current flow if its **positive**?
-  What do these symbols represent?How do they differ. ![](public/assets/Pasted%20image%2020250224100448.png)
## Part 2 Resistance and Resistors
- What is **Resistivity** and **Resistance**?
- What is the **formula** for **Resistance**?
- What is a **Resistor**
- **Do** resistivity of different materials differ?
- What happens if you connect resistors in **series**?
- What is the **formula**?
- What happens if you connect resistors in **parallel**?
- What is the **formula**?
- What is the formula of **conductance** in terms of Resistance?
- What if there are resistors in parallel where all the resistors have the same value (think of simplifying the formula)
- What is the colour coding of resistors convention?
	- Order of bands?
	- Order of colours (for SF & Multiplier)?
	- What is reliability rate in resistors?

## Part 3 Ohm's Law
- What is the definition of Ohm's Law (in simple words)?
- What is the formula of Ohm's Law?
- What is Ohm's Law Triangle? (This is less relevant if you remember the formula)

## Part 4 Voltage and Current Dividers
- What are voltage dividers?
	- (The voltage of all the individual resistors IN A SERIES sums up to the total voltage of the power supply - disregarding loss of voltage)
- What are current dividers?
	- Current is split in PARALLEL and sums to the original current (?)

## Part 5 Kirchhoff's Law
- What is Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)?
- What is Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)?

## Part 6 Electric Power and Energy
- What is power?
- What is the formula for Power (P) in terms of V,Q,t?
- What is the formula for Power (P) in terms of voltage & current?
- What is the formula for Power (P) using Ohm's Law?
- What is electrical energy?
- What is the formula for electrical energy?
- What is the unit of Energy?
- What is the formula for Energy?
- How is electrical bill calculated?
