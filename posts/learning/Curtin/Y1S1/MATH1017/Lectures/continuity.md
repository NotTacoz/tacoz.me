- okay lets do this
- lecture
- i hate this already
- hes getting a set of the real numbers with a limit
	- a function that puts A -> R
	- basic epsilon proof
	- for all epsilon, there exists a epsilon (precision above 0)
	- standard epsilon delta definition for every precision from the limit, there exists a limit that guarantees the precision
- he then talks about convergent : converging functions
	- he defines convergency as
	- if there exists a limit such that a condition applies
		- (same as epsilon-delta im pretty sure)
- more restrictive (?). i think hes referring to limits idk
- continuity is ONLY defined for points, no derived set
	- what is a derived set
		- subset of topological space set of all limit points contains infinity many points
		- this still doesnt make sense to me
		- derived set A' are all limit points in A
	- epsilon-delta definiton again
	- im not sure what hes trying to get at this?
		- such there is only a small difference
	- before he continues, he will explain the definition of contijnuity
	- He takes a parabola and a point at x0. 
	- he takes f(x0)
	- definition is simple for continuity
		- wouldnt work for discountinosu function
	- i dnt really udnerstand what hes typing
- he takes the function H(x) that jumps from 0 to 1 at x=0
	- this is called the heavy side function
	- why is this not continous.
	- if he takes a epsilon around 1 (remember this is like region around the y at x=1)
	- idk what hes talkign about 
	- oh i get it because theres a point that is not in the epsilon?
	- hes like writing but the lecture isnt updating
	- oh nvm its updating
- intuitively a continous function is such a pen is always on the paper and never leaves (but dats obvious fr)
- 1) f is cont. if it is cont at x0, \forall x \in A
	- this is saying continous if its continous at its limit
	- something about locale definitions
	- neighbourhood of f of age of 1??
	- he is finding a neighbourhood of 1 so he can find value that is contained with that ? i dont really get it
- taking epsilon at -2 of H(x) he can always find a value of a neighbourhood that is contained within the thing.
- he now invites us to think abt it...  because its interesting. thanks teach.
- explore the relationship with the result that makes it clear
- A is in set R f: A -> R, x0 \in A
	- x0 \in A \ D(A), (x0 is isolated)
		- f is cont, at x0
		- idk what hes talking abt rn tbh.
		- isolated point as a point that is outside the range
		- \[-1,1\] and 2, means 2 is the isolated point
		- idk the point hes trying to make
		- i dont really like the accent/his way of explaining
		- but maybe im dumb.
- if x0 \in A \intersect D(A) if x is a limit point (its saying x0 is NOT isolated), f cont at x0 <=> lim(x_>x0) f(x) exists and is equal to f(x0)
- he now wants us to think about how to justify the first one
- if you use r as the radius?/ what he talking about now
	- intersection with a and 2 is a isolated point 
	- hes just saying words bruh.
	- f takes just a value of 2?
- for every epsilon > 0, there exists delta > 0, 
	- classic epsilon delta definition
	- im not sure the justification. it is very confusing.
	- are we meant to have all this in our brain.
- "Result is trivially true: 
	- If we consider isolated points, the function is automatically continues" ?? I have no idea what this mean is the lecturer just saying random shit or am i not undersrtanding it
- this is so torteorous.
	- we need to prove continuity is essentially at that point at the existence of the limit where the limit is x0. isnt x0 defined as the limit?
- two claims to prove
	- implication 1 assume f cont at x0
		- there existas. bound such the distance between a point and the limit point is smaller than epsilon for all epsilon > 0
		- he takes away x0 fromt eh thing. and the definition is same
			- what?
			- hes saying limit exists and is equal to l? what
	- implication opposite: assuming f(x)) = lim(x->x0) f(x)??
		- \\forall epsilon > 0 \exists \de,ta > 0: \forall x \in B(x0) \intersect A
			- x != x0 => |f(x)-f(x0)|<\epsion
		- inequality is true
		- x0 is a point of a??
		- bro im so lost hes saying random shit and im just typing it down
		- trivially true. 
- to repeat, he defines function continues at a point then f is continous
	- f: A->R is cont if it is continous at x0 if \forall x0 \in A
		- so its continous if its continous at every point??
	- consequence of result we just proved
	- i feel i get this
	- x -> x^a where a>0. this is continous because limit exists?
	- the asme is true for (0, +inf) -> R
		- x|-> x^a a <0
	- a >0 a^x is continous
	- hes just fucking listing continous functions now
	- like wtf i get that its continous what the f is ur point bruh
	- nah im crashing out 1000 words and im only 20 min into this lecture
- operations wtf
	- stop stammering
	- result is similar to result for limits
	- A -> R where A \subset R, f + g and f \times g.
	- why is he multiplying it and adding them
	- this subject explaination fricking blows
	- i feel like i should watch youtube videos with competent lecturers and crank the textbook with solved solutions
	- am i stupid i never struggle with math
	- this is so upsetting.
	- advanced calc ...
	- in order to be able to give a meaning to this (?))
	- we need a core domain
	- core domain addition
	- same thing for multiplication
	- hes defining multiplication
	- a can be any set he wants?
	- (sine + cosine) (x) = sin(x)+cos(x)
		- sum of two graphs
	- (sin.cos)(x) = sin(x).cos(x) bruh
		- what hes talking about
		- sum and product keeps it continous i guess? idfk
	- (f-g)(x) = f(x) +(- g(x))
	- f/g: A -> R, x+> f(x)/g(x), g(x) != 0, so the function doesnt break and becomes NOT defined
- what
- hes supposing that f.g: A->R, x0 \in A
	- HES JUST JUMPING AROUND IDEK WHAT HES DOING HE DOESNT SAY WHAT HES DOING AM I CRAZY 
- f + g is cont at x0 now talking about high school. f(x) is not a function it is a name of the function.  if f(x) = sin(x) sin is the function f is the NAME applied to the generic point, and these symbols (f?) is obsolote when denoting functions (so whats teh point?)
- 2 fg is cont at x0
- if g(x) != 0, \forall x \in A, f/g is cont at x0
- first situation: x0 is isolated.
- so hes saying that if f,g is continous then the addition multiplication and division are all cont at x0 (where x0 is any arbitrary point of the domain A)
- x0 is isolated
	- lim x->x0
	- lim x->x0
	- limit of sum is sum of limit (what)
	- if x0 is a limi tpoint in the domain, blah bla alah
- this might be the greatest waste of time of all time.
