- not all material is required knowledge
- looking at australia lots of commodities Woaw
- copper other materials
- renewable metals
- metals in magnets
- nickels
- a lot of stuf found in center of state (wa australia)
- lower and lower grades, more poorer quality, more complex to find. middle of nowhere, 
- its hader to get
- evolving legisilation
- mning can not be done isolation
- it must be low emission must be good for the citizen very good.
- puppy looking in the mirror, challenges -> opportunity.
- economical growth.
- need for resources on emerging countries
- renewable energy: escondica lots of copper and , and we want several of these copper plants to come onlien to meet it
- geology - analysis, think about the next 6 months
- mining engineering - safety ventilatoon adn logistics and production
	- map out based on the ore body. should it be pitch or undergorund
	- cutoff grade
	- economics of it
	- how much stress can a rock take and how stable it is
	- how stable is the suppport system
	- onitoriing
- metallurgy - design, how to process,o pereation phase and do upgrades, continue to upgrade
- struggling miner
- no deposit is the same
- every deposite is difference
- just becuase there is grade doesn't mean it's economic
- asx no way
- mill on site admin and stuff
- shortern distance
- drill and blast, break rock with explosives BOOM
- protect the staff if rock can not handle stress
- intersect with water table with particularly deep mines
- blow up under and rock falls wow
- metallurgy beneficiation smelting refining (minecraft stuff)
- comminution: crushing milling and grinding the rocks
	- big rock to small rock!
- 1-3 crushers at a time
- leaching slective dissolution
- purifyi g it: remove some of the impurity elements
- emission: lots of roasters asthma avoid coming
	- shutting down emissions
	- roasters bad sulfur dioxide LOTS bad bad bad
	- wether bad
	- legislation change that gas being blown towards the population so operating time decreasing so they use a different type of roasting
	- mm smart
- 650 
- iron sulfide convert to oxide no longer generate sulfur dioxide
- dam are extremely common
- sao paulo polluted 600km and killed a bunch of people
- a lot of push to build dams with safety
- filter it ands tack it and dry
	- avoids mud sludge
	- storage system
	- stable for thousands fo years
	- remediation: mobile metals in contaminated or mineralised areas water comings
		- bring metals kills off very easily bio accumuilation
		- highly tolerated
		- promotes vegetarian
		- ?? more ways to extract metal disturbance
		- zero carbon footprint, when you burn you recover the metal
		- the more produts we produce
		- large scale renewable energy
		- finite life contains massive amounts of metal
		- to the point enormous amount
		- circular economy yay!
- reprocess materials yay
- we can use these materials for contructon ! big legacies. Yes thanks
- more arrows. more oppportunities to recyle
- more waste streams to sned back
- hence the ciruclar economy the full life cycle to get rid of any of the waste we are producing but like use it somehow so we get out of somethin 
- what is phytomining
	- mining metals from soil using plants
- deposite shape composition.
	- secondary resources
	- dependent on process and waste material
	- logistics
	- social environmetnal factors ?w hat t dow hen you close your mine?
	- all native flora/fauna that used to be there what happens there?
- very interesting segment.
