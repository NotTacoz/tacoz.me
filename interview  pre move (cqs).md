- How does the committee collaborate?
    
- Biggest challenge/focus right now?

**7. STAR Examples**

#### Problem Solving
- **S:** When I first solved the Two Sum problem.
- **T:** I needed to find two numbers in an array that sum to a given target.
- **A:** Initially, I used a brute force approach, checking every pair (O(n²)). After realising it was inefficient, I optimised it by using a hash map to track seen numbers in O(1) time.
- **R:** This reduced time complexity to O(n) and reinforced my ability to recognise when data structures can optimise solutions.
#### Teamwork
- **S:** My high school friends and I built a Chrome extension that rewrites retro games using JS Canvas. 
- **T:** The project involved many games, leaderboards, settings. To simplify the monumental task, we delegated tasks to develop different parts of the extension.
- **A:** I was responsible for the landing page,  contributed to the main extension logic, and handled graphic design.
- **R:** We successfully scaled the extension to 400K+ users.
#### Learning
- **S:** I had to learn an entirely new tech stack to build a full-stack social media web app for my CS class.
- **T:** I chose React.js, Tailwind CSS, Firebase for authentication/database—none of which I had used before. Halfway through, I decided to port the project to TypeScript.
- **A:** I dove into documentation, experimented through trial and error, and referenced Stack Overflow to implement features.
- **R:** I successfully built a responsive UI with authentication, user posting, notifications, accounts, and a following system. Receiving an 100% mark.

**8. Closing:**

- Thank the interviewers: Thank you again for your time and consideration; I'm very enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to CQS.
