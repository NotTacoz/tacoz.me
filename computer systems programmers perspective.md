## chapter 2: representing and manipulating information
- computers use binary
- binary is so important because many systems utilise an on/off switch - clockwise vs counter cockwise, high vs low voltage, input on or off.
- three important encodings of numbers:
- unsigned encoding: non negative integers within a finite range
- two's complement signed integers within a finite range
- floating point: finite subset of rational numbers used to approximate real numbers.
- integer limit is $2^{31}$, where the first bit is used to represent the sign (pos or neg)
- computing expressions above the integer limit is problematic
