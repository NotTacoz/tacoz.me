A concept which highly resonates with me. I am not too big on winning publicly, because I feel in a western society becoming more individualistic, a large amount of people (including me) operate on a me-first priority. 

I believe that if you share your successes publicly, you meet a few groups of people:
- a small number of people genuinely believed your vision from the start and supported you. the truth is this is a small number, maybe even zero. at most one or two people will have supported you through thick and thin
- people who wants to use you to further themselves - whether wanting to use your resources or intellectual property. people would reverse engineer to obtain the **how** you did something - so let them.

There are some key disadvantages to succeeding privately:
- You can obtain no feedback to what you have done
- Thats basically it

Here is a reinforced principle I want to stick by:
- Privacy is Law: Share for the sake of publishing.
- Accountability needs to be from oneself: Do not rely on commitment / accountability from third parties
- Friendly Not Transparent
